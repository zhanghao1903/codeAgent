# Release Records

This directory records completed phases, milestones, and important feature slices.

Release records should answer:

- what shipped;
- which docs and code areas changed;
- what was validated;
- which follow-ups remain.

When a release closes or changes a known gap, update [Gap Registry](../gaps/)
alongside the release record.
